# Assignment 2 - Usability Testing (UT)

## Purpose of UT
Usability testing is a process within user-centered design (UCD) meant to evaluate the functionality and usability of a product. This is done by live testing it with a participant/user with a moderator/observer to identify and learn how the user experience is with completing tasks and interacting with the specific product. 

Seeing how a user behaves can help designers to understand what needs to be changed or improved with the design to create a better overall experience for users.

The app in which the UT was conducted on is [Yousician](https://yousician.com/). Per [Assignment 1's Heuristic Evaluation](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/blob/main/Assignment%201/Heuristic%20Evalulation%20-%20Yousician.pdf), there were some some usability heuristic  issues identified, which were aimed to be the focus of this UT. 

Specifically these are (in no specific order):
1. Accessibility / Help + Documentation
2. Recongition rather than recall
3. Error Prevention

When I conducted the herusitic evaluation, I felt some difficulty and confusion when initially choosing instruments. I felt like there wasn't any walkthrough or help with the navigation, and thus finding specific lessons or certain areas were difficult. 

Thus, I designed some tasks within the Yousician app that would cover problems like that with these usability heuristics. This would help me to observe how a user navigates and interacts with the app to further improve these aspects.

## Reflection
What you learned
After conducting this usability testing in a pilot study with a user, I was able to see from an outside perspective how another user struggled in the same way I did, which was interesting to see some similar experiences. For example, switching between instruments shows a whole new layout, so my user had some difficulty navigating the individual components of each instrument. Overall, it helped to confirm some of the issues I uncovered during my heuristic evaluations, so I would say it was very helpful.
In terms of what went well, I think it was managable considering it was over zoom. I had my user share their mobile phone screen, and I recorded using zoom. There were definitely times I wanted to butt in and say that my user was doing things wrong or right, but I tried to rememeber what makes a good moderator and stay unbiased and more hands-off. Furthermore, I feel like I could have designed the tasks to be a bit more difficult or longer, as I think my user was able to go through them faster than expected. For example, I did not have my user actually try some of the exercises/lessons within the app - I just had them navigate and find. I think having the user actually "use" the app could be interesting; however, it would require an actual instrument or singing, which is why I opted to not have it in the first place. Otherwise, I think the UT went pretty smoothly.
