# Assignment 5 - Low Fidelity Prototype

## Project Description
__Purpose:__ Low-fidelity prototyping allows for a designer to contextualize and visualize how features might work and be laid out before finalizing and diving into the actual development. Understanding these aspects provides insight and feedback as to what does or doesn't work. Prototyping in this way gives a sense of what the final product could look like in an easier, less time-consuming manner. In regards to my project, I hope to tackle problems commonly faced with music learning apps. 

__User Personas + Research:__ The user research I conducted focued on middle-aged males who are interested in music learning. Learning from a [Contextual Inquiry](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%203) as well as trying to understand from a user's perspective in [user personas and scenarios](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%204), I was able to get a sense of what features could be included or improved in already-existing music learning apps/resources. One major thing that I wanted to highlight was the idea that there's no one right way to learn music, but I think it's important to have be goal-oriented. So, I thought that being able to have the user pick and choose from a general list of skills that they then would associate to their goals as they see fit would help to fine tune what skills seem to fulfill their goal the most. Howev er, the user can still practice their general skills in order to improve overall as a musician.

## Features/Tasks
1. Practice a skill (including other resources)
2. View/edit goals + progress

## Wireframes + Wireflows

__Flow Description:__ The flow of the app starts off with a home page that branches into either the "view current goals" or "practice skills" pages. In the goals page, there are multiple features like: viewing the calendar for streaks, editing or removing goals, creating new goals, and viewing current goals. For editing goals, one is able to edit the skills associated with the goal, edit the frequency of working on the goals, and rating the skills associated with the goals. Within the practice skills pages, there's a simple flow that includes selecting the category of skills to choose from to then seeing an overview of the activities and resources for the skill, and then finally a description to start and activity.

__Feature Description:__ 
1. View Current Goals
*  Track progress on accomplishing goals
* Can associate the skills necessary to building the skill
* After every so often, have the user rate the skill necessary to see if it was helpful in accomplishing their goal

2. Practice Skills
* list of all skill available to practice
* categorized skills
* additionally sorted by difficulty
* includes resources + lessons


## Reflections
Overall, this helped me to gain a birds-eye view of how everything would work together. I think it was a great experience to really think about the flow and what things make sense to be connected to each other. Additionally, seeing how a user tried to navigate and test through my wireframe really gave me insight for what things are clear/unclear. For example, one thing I learned that I could do differently or improve upon is my goals page. I think the main goals page has a lot of interactions that seem a little bit cluttered or can be confusing. I think the organization could be improved and thought out a little bit more. Furthermore, I think some of the features that I would like to incorporate are a little bit difficult to show on a low fidelity prototype. For editing or removing goals, I want to incorporate a swiping motion that either edits or removes the goal depending on what direction the user swipes on. But since there is also an interaction from simply tapping, I think differentiating the 3 isn't the most clear on my prtotype. Overall, I think it was a fun experience, and I'm excited to improve my design more and actually develop it in the future!
