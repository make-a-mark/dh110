# Assignment 4 - Low Fidelity Prototype

## Project Description
__Purpose:__ Low-fidelity prototyping allows for a designer to contextualize and visualize how features might work and be laid out before finalizing and diving into the actual development. Understanding these aspects provides insight and feedback as to what does or doesn't work. Prototyping in this way gives a sense of what the final product could look like in an easier, less time-consuming manner. In regards to my project, I hope to tackle problems commonly faced with music learning apps. 

__User Personas + Research:__ The user research I conducted focued on middle-aged males who are interested in music learning. Learning from a [Contextual Inquiry](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%203) as well as trying to understand from a user's perspective in [user personas and scenarios](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%204), I was able to get a sense of what features could be included or improved in already-existing music learning apps/resources. One major thing that I wanted to highlight was the idea that there's no one right way to learn music, but I think it's important to have be goal-oriented. So, I thought that being able to have the user pick and choose from a general list of skills that they then would associate to their goals as they see fit would help to fine tune what skills seem to fulfill their goal the most. Howev er, the user can still practice their general skills in order to improve overall as a musician.

## Features/Tasks
1. Practice a skill (including other resources)
2. View/edit goals + progress

## Wireframes + Wireflows

## Prototype Testing

__Flow Description:__ 

__Feature Description:__ View Current Goals = Track progress on accomplishing goals
Can associate the skills necessary to building the skill

After every so often, have the user rate the skill necessary to see if it was helpful in accomplishing their goal

Practice Skills = list of all skill available to practice
