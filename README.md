# M(UI/UX)SIC ðŸŽµ
by Mark Andal

## Introduction
For middle-aged male users, music learning may not come so easy. There's a wide range of skillsets and no one-size-fits-all solution to the problems a user might face when learning music. This project aims to approach this problem from a UI/UX perspective in order to help ease the difficulties of music learning. Thus with M(UI/UX)SIC, I hope to learn from applicable target users, identify pain points, and create a create an easy-to-use, user-centered music learning app. 

## Clear Design Statement
Understanding that not every user is the same, this app provides recommendations for musical skills that can help to fulfill the user's goals. These skills can then be rated in order to give feeback on if they are truly helping, and users can customize which skills they would like to associated for each of their goals. Thus, this app tries to cater to each user's individualized needs.

## Competitor Analysis
To get a sense of what is already being done, I conducted heuristic evaluations and usability testing. 

### Heuristic Evaluations
For heuristic evaluations, I conducted case studies on two music-learning apps - [Yousician](https://yousician.com/) and [Earpeggio](https://earpeggio.com/) - to understand what they are doing well and what they aren't doing well in regards to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). I saw that Yousician had strength in its variety of lessons, while Earpeggio helps to train the musical ear. However, both could be more clear in their instruction for first-time users.

### Usability Testing
Usability testing (UT) is a process within user-centered design (UCD) meant to evaluate the functionality and usability of a product. This is done by live testing it with a participant/user with a moderator/observer to identify and learn how the user experience is with completing tasks and interacting with the specific product. I conducted the UT with Yousician. [Read more here!](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%202)

## User Research
For user research, the method I utilized is Participation Observation Research. This allows the opportunity to learn from people in context by holding conversations with users in the context of their work. I specifically interviewed/observed Nick Pascua, a self-taught music mixer and producer. By doing so, I was able to gather insights from the their perspective to help better understand and gain inspiration. It was what helped me to realize that music journeys can be drastically different, and it's hard to create a fix-all solution. So, I wanted to come up with something that the users can personalize to themselves. [Read more here!](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%203)

## UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows for a more personal feel. By understanding the user's perspective, their needs can be more catered to, and they can have a better overall experience. To do this, I created 2 personas, empathy maps, and scenario/journey maps to put myself in the shoes of someone that could potentially utilize my app. [Read more here!](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%204)

## Low Fidelity Prototype
The user research I conducted focued on middle-aged males who are interested in music learning. Learning from a [Contextual Inquiry](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%203) as well as trying to understand from a user's perspective in [user personas and scenarios](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%204), I was able to get a sense of what features could be included or improved in already-existing music learning apps/resources. One major thing that I wanted to highlight was the idea that there's no one right way to learn music, but I think it's important to have be goal-oriented. So, I thought that being able to have the user pick and choose from a general list of skills that they then would associate to their goals as they see fit would help to fine tune what skills seem to fulfill their goal the most. However, the user can still practice their general skills in order to improve overall as a musician. [Read more here!](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%205)

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation
For the overall graphical interface design, I wanted to have a clean, easy-on-the-eyes look and feel. There are a mix of warm and cool colors, but there's nothing very intrusive or popping out as much. I want the music learning experience to be relaxing and enjoyable, and I thought having something that is easy to stare at can help support that goal. I arrived at these stylistic decisions by comparing different design element variations.[Read more here!](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%206)

## High Fidelity Prototype
After completing ideation with the low fidelity prototype and making stylistic design element choices, I put it all together in a high fidelity prototype using figma. Again, the two main features/tasks are:

1. Practice a skill (including other resources)
2. View/edit goals + progress
