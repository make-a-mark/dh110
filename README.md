# M(UI/UX)SIC ðŸŽµ
by Mark Andal

## Introduction
For middle-aged male users, music learning may not come so easy. There's a wide range of skillsets and no one-size-fits-all solution to the problems a user might face when learning music. This project aims to approach this problem from a UI/UX perspective in order to help ease the difficulties of music learning. Thus with M(UI/UX)SIC, I hope to learn from applicable target users, identify pain points, and create a create an easy-to-use, user-centered music learning app. 

## Clear Design Statement
Understanding that not every user is the same, this app provides recommendations for musical skills that can help to fulfill the user's goals. These skills can then be rated in order to give feeback on if they are truly helping, and users can customize which skills they would like to associated for each of their goals. Thus, this app tries to cater to each user's individualized needs.

## Competitor Analysis
To get a sense of what is already being done, I conducted heuristic evaluations and usability testing.
