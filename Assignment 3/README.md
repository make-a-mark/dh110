# Assignment 3 - Contextual Inquiry

## Research Goal + Requirements
### Main Activity
This project would support those wanting to invest time and energy into learning musics. The main activity to do so would be to provide lessons or resources for users to utilize in their practice and studying. 

### Requirements / Constraints
Seeing as the target user is a middle-aged man, the activites would need to be catered and designed in a way that is intuitive and easy to understand. 

### Traditional/Current Solutions
Traditional and current solutions include in-person lessons, classes, or looking for free resources online or with apps. 

### Limitations
With free resources, it can be difficult to cater specifically to one's needs. Since websites, apps, or videos usually try to target a wide audience, the content is generalized and can be difficult to find the perfect equation to teach everybody without giving specialized help.

## Target User

### Demographics
A middle-aged (38-60) male

### Preferences
Preferably, one that is interested in or utilizing some sort of music learning.

### Expertise
There need not be any prior experience.

## Research Methods
The research method I utilized is Participation Observation Research. This allows the opportunity to learn from people in context by holding conversations with users in the context of their work. In doing so, I hope to gather insights from the user's perspective to help better understand and gain inspiration.

## Observation Notes + Takeaways

9:50 - Are there any resources that you look online like tutorial videos or  any particular websites that helped you learn or improve when you're using those softwares?
> Yeah, so like, I would say the difficult thing is that not every producer is the same and it's, it's really hard. Even going on YouTube because one YouTuber might tell you something different... And I would just say that, although there's a lot of resources out there that I use. There's not a one size fit all.

19:44 - For beginners, do you think online websites that are accessible are useful for learning? 
> Yeah, I would definitely start with something that's free for sure... Like there's probably other websites and programs out there that are like, oh free lessons are free, like, whatever. So I definitely say like, obviously utilize your resources. Because music is an expensive like field, right? 

25:21 - Start of the activity demonstration process
> I can start from like how I like I can I can do like from start to finish [of a song]

41:00 - Is it more just like experimentation for the methods of how to learn and improve on these things, is there any right way, a good way that you think there is to do so?
> It's definitely a lot of experimentation based on the songs that you want to create, and like the effects that you want to put into the song. So yeah, there's definitely an experimental part. But how you want to do it better by like listening to like artists who use the same like things like the vision artists who uses a lot of like reverb, or like echo in the background, and you want to mimic that same thing, then you definitely want to look up like some tutorial on YouTube, like, oh, how to do it, like this artist.

44:00 - What kind of problems do you have when you're trying to learn how to do all these? How do you overcome those kind of problems or difficulties when you're trying to learn these things?
> Yeah, I feel like the most difficult part is that like, when I'm watching a YouTube video, they would use like a vocal from like, the, the channel or someone from the channel, right? And like, okay, I can follow along, and then I do with my own vocals. It totally sounds bad. What happened here, I literally follow the same instructions. And like I did everything, right. It's just that my voice is different. I have to, you have to accept that it's not going to be the same as the person that you were editing on YouTube. And yeah, it's definitely not a one size fits all thing. So you have to play along with it. Like I said, it's really experimental in the beginning. Because you don't know what everything does you just kind of playing along. But it does give me a general idea of what I want. So I would have to go back. And with the new knowledge, I know from watching the video, I would do, I wouldn't be more experimental with it, but just have a better knowledge of it/


## Reflection
Overall, this contextual inquiry was a great way to learn from a user and gain some new insight. It was really interesting to hear how one with a music production background would go about improving their musical ability when trying to create a song. I think they really hit the nail on the head when they said that there's not one size fits all for resources that they would look for or for anybody, really, to utilize. For him, it's a lot more of gaining knowledge through these resources and then doing more knowledgable experimentation for trying to hone and fine tune his music. 

Overall, I think the interview went pretty smooth. I definitely did not follow my script entirely, as I moreso went with the flow and asked follow-up questions depending on how the interviewee was answering. If I were to do this again, I think it would be helpful to ask the interviewee to prepare some more of the resources that they utilized because as they were searching in the moment, they were having difficulty finding some things. Otherwise, it was great to see a demonstration with the software that they use and their process in learning and improving for music production.
