# Assignment 6 - Interface Design System

## Description
This project aims to create an easy-to-use, user-centered music learning app. Understanding that not every user is the same, this app provides recommendations for musical skills that can help to fulfill the user's goals. These skills can then be rated in order to give feeback on if they are truly helping, and users can customize which skills they would like to associated for each of their goals. Thus, this app tries to cater to each individual user's needs.

This interface design system represents a digitalized [Low Fidelity Prototype](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%205) that demonstrates the flows between pages and the main tasks:

1. Practice a skill (including other resources)
2. View/edit goals + progress

To create the interface design system, I utilized Figma. Deciding to model the app using an iPhone 11 Pro Max Screen, I then converted my low fidelity screens into digital screens. This was done in an iterative fashion by determining typography, shapes, colors, layout, etc and then configuring the graphic designs.

## Impression Test
For the impression test, in addition to general thoughts, I wanted to make sure my tester gave feedback on 2 things in particular:

1. Size of buttons
2. Color scheme (dark buttons vs lighter buttons)

[Here is the recording of the impression test]()

After conducting my impression test, the feedback and insight I gained was very valuable.
