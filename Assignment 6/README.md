# Assignment 6 - Interface Design System

## Description
This project aims to create an easy-to-use, user-centered music learning app. Understanding that not every user is the same, this app provides recommendations for musical skills that can help to fulfill the user's goals. These skills can then be rated in order to give feeback on if they are truly helping, and users can customize which skills they would like to associated for each of their goals. Thus, this app tries to cater to each individual user's needs.

This interface design system represents a digitalized [Low Fidelity Prototype](https://github.com/make-a-mark/dh110/tree/main/Assignment%205) that demonstrates the flows between pages and the main tasks:

1. Practice a skill (including other resources)
2. View/edit goals + progress

To create the interface design system, I utilized Figma. Deciding to model the app using an iPhone 11 Pro Max Screen, I then converted my low fidelity screens into digital screens. This was done in an iterative fashion by determining typography, shapes, colors, layout, etc and then configuring the graphic designs.

### Wireframe + Graphic Interface Design Link

## Screen Design

### Layout

### Typography
I compared 3 different sans-serif fonts: Inter, PT Sans, and Work Sans. PT Sans didn't have as many options for styling (though it did have PT Sans Narrow for example) which I thought was necessary for changing the purposes of the fonts, so I decided between Inter and Work Sans. I thought Inter just had the best feel.

### Shape
For the shape, I utilized a different wireframe so that I could get a better sense of how more objects in the screen would look versus the first screen I used for typography. I looked at how roundness affected the shapes of the buttons and smaller details like progress bars.

### Color Schemes

## Impression Test
For the impression test, in addition to general thoughts, I wanted to make sure my tester gave feedback on 2 things in particular:

1. Size of buttons
2. Color scheme (dark buttons vs lighter buttons)

[Here is the recording of the impression test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_XkbuKP9zV0K5z4w0yP-zPZp-KKajN0e/view?usp=sharing)

After conducting my impression test, the feedback and insight I gained was very valuable. I listened to my tester and kept the variety in button style as well as keeping larger buttons to take up more whitespace. 

## Accessibility Check

## Design System
For the overall graphical interface design, I wanted to have a clean, easy-on-the-eyes look and feel. There are a mix of warm and cool colors, but there's nothing very intrusive or popping out as much. I want the music learning experience to be relaxing and enjoyable, and I thought having something that is easy to stare at can help support that goal.
