# Assignment 7 - High Fidelity Prototype

## Description
This project aims to create an easy-to-use, user-centered music learning app. Understanding that not every user is the same, this app provides recommendations for musical skills that can help to fulfill the user's goals. These skills can then be rated in order to give feeback on if they are truly helping, and users can customize which skills they would like to associated for each of their goals. Thus, this app tries to cater to each individual user's needs.

## Tasks
1. Practice a skill (including other resources)
2. View/edit goals + progress

__Summary and findings:__
The congitive walkthrough was helpful to gain some outside understanding of how the flow of you app works. Obviously as the creator, I know what can be done and how everything works, but seeing how any new user might go about using my app is insightful. For example, there are some features like swiping to edit the goal and viewing current progress of goals that aren't very clear. There should be more signifiers of what can and can't be done, and so that is something I worked to improve. Otherwise, I think the general usage of the app is clear, and I'm glad that there weren't any other big issues.
