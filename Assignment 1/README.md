# Assignment 1 - Heuristic Evaluation
## M(UI/UX)SIC ðŸŽ¶

Through M(UI/UX)Sic, I hope to conduct case studies on two music-learning apps to understand what they are doing well and what they aren't doing well in regards to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

In doing so, I would like to improve upon the designs of these apps and suggest them to the app-makers to ensure that their apps are serving their users as best as possible.


### Digital Humanities 110 Spring 2022 - User Interface & Design:
