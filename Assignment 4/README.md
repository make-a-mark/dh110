## Scenarios + Journey Maps
### Feature 1 + Scenario 1 - Guillermo learns a song on guitar

### Why

After boasting about how he used to be a musical prodigy to his wife for what seems like ages now, Guillermo decides it's probably time to put words into action. He's been an artist at heart since a very young age, and he's had a flair for romance too. Madly in love with his wife, he wants to learn one of his favorite songs growing up - "Te Amo" by Franco de Vita. But, it's been years since he last played and picked up the guitar. Though there might be some familiary feelings here and there, Guillermo is practically starting from the beginning again! Thus, he needs to start with the basics, like reading notes, how to make chords on the guitar, understanding how to strum, etc. 

### How
Guillermo decides to use an app that will help to develop his skills and build up his musical knowledge so that he can ultimately play that song for his wife! This app will give him weekly tasks that instruct Guillermo to focus on certain beginner skills like how to strum, how to place your fingers on the frets to create a chord, etc. He can track his progress and learn through hands-on activities and lessons that use the mic to listen to his playing so that he can test his abilities!

### Feature 2 + Scenario 2 - Aryo learns how to produce his first song

### Why
Aryo wants to pursue music making. He has a great singing voice, but he's never dabbled in actually writing a song, let alone producing a song! But, he is inspired by his favorite artists from 88 Rising, and everytime one of them drops a new song or album, he always thinks to himself that he wants to do that. So, he decided that now is the time! Taking influence from their style of songs, Aryo wants to incorporate elements and styles from 88 Rising artists and combine it with his own flair to create a sound unique to Aryo. Just like how their music makes him happy, he hopes that his music will make others happy in the same way! 

### How
Aryo wants to use an app that provides step-by-step tutorials on how to produce a song from scratch. He's hoping that for anything he might find difficult (since he doesn't have an extensive music background), he can utilize the other resources the app provides to train his musical ear and overall develop his musical abilities. Right now, the app utilizes the phone's built-in microphone to record sounds, but he hopes to buy more professional equipment and software in the future once he gains enough skills and confidence!
