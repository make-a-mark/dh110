## Scenarios + Journey Maps
### Feature 1 + Scenario 1 - Guillermo learns a song on guitar

### Why

After boasting about how he used to be a musical prodigy to his wife for what seems like ages now, Guillermo decides it's probably time to put words into action. He's been an artist at heart since a very young age, and he's had a flair for romance too. Madly in love with his wife, he wants to learn one of his favorite songs growing up - "Te Amo" by Franco de Vita. But, it's been years since he last played and picked up the guitar. Though there might be some familiary feelings here and there, Guillermo is practically starting from the beginning again! Thus, he needs to start with the basics, like reading notes, how to make chords on the guitar, understanding how to strum, etc. 

### How
Guillermo decides to use an app that will help to develop his skills and build up his musical knowledge so that he can ultimately play that song for his wife! This app will give him weekly tasks that instruct Guillermo to focus on certain beginner skills like how to strum, how to place your fingers on the frets to create a chord, etc. He can track his progress and learn through hands-on activities and lessons that use the mic to listen to his playing so that he can test his abilities!
